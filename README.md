Small android app, developed in Java, that classifies a person picture through a convolutional neural network. Through a transfer learning approach, the convolutional base of the VGG-Face neural network was extracted and linked to fully connected layers, which were trained on the LFW dataset, so to then classify the gender of the person in the picture (98 % accuracy on front pictures).
